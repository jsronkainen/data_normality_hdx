## Introduction

The adult dataset is from the 1994 Census database. It is also known as “Census Income” dataset. Details of this dataset can be found at UCI Machine Learning Repository. We will use this dataset to explore normality of certain kind of data.

```{r}

library(moments) # loading the package 
library(dplyr)
library(goft)
library(hdxr)
library(devtools)


rm(list = ls())

dataset<-read.table("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data",header=FALSE,sep=",",stringsAsFactors = FALSE,na.strings="NA")

 

# naming the variables of data set

names(dataset)<-c("age","workclass","fnlwgt","education","education_number","marital_status","occupation","relationship","race","sex","capital_gain","capital_loss","hours_per_week","native_country","class")

# looking at summary of the data

str(dataset)
```

Next let's look at two variables in this dataset: age and capital_gain, where age is self explanatory and capital_gain presents whether the household have any gains from investment sources other than wage/salary.

Let's first explore some standard descriptive statistics of these two varitables

```{r}
age_data <- dataset$age
mean_age<-mean(age_data)
cat("mean age is", mean_age, "\n")
sd_age<-sd(age_data)
cat("standard deviation of age is", sd_age, "\n")
kurtosis_age <-kurtosis(age_data)
cat("kurtosis of age is", kurtosis_age, "\n")

capital_data <-dataset$capital_gain
mean_capital <-mean(capital_data)
cat("mean capital gain is", mean_capital, "\n")
sd_capital <-sd(capital_data)
cat("standard deviation of capital gain is", sd_capital, "\n")
kurtosis_capital <- kurtosis(capital_data)
cat("kurtosis of capital gain is", kurtosis_capital, "\n")
```

Let's further examine how the datasets look like by plotting plotting both datasets. After all, we want to see what we have. Considering that both variables are discrete variables, we can just scatterplot them by placing index (observation) on the x axis and the value on the y axis. 

```{r}
plot(age_data, main = "Age data", xlab = "Observations", ylab = "age")
```
This doesn't look very informative so let's analyze the data a bit. We could use a histogram, but since the data is "discrete" I'll just count the occurences of each age present in the dataset. 

```{r}
age_counts <- table(age_data)
plot(age_counts)
```
Now we can fairly easily see that the dataset (population) behaves somehwat "normally", and this means that if we were to take standard reach samples with a 95% confidence level with a margin of error of 10%, we can fairly confidentally say that our sample indeed represents the reality=population. But before that I want to quickly confirm the population is indeed normally distributed, i.e. 68% of the values fall between one standard deviation from the mean. 

```{r}
lower_limit <- mean_age - sd_age
upper_limit <- mean_age + sd_age
between_sd_values <- age_data[age_data >= lower_limit & age_data <= upper_limit]
percentage_between_sd_values <- length(between_sd_values)/length(age_data)
cat("And as we see, ", percentage_between_sd_values, " falls within one standard deviation from the mean, meaning our dataset looks fairly normal indeed with a kurtosis of ", kurtosis_age, " meaning the dataseet doesn't have a fat tail as shouldn't be the case as anything above 3 for kurtosis shoudl make us worry.")

```


```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  REACH_sample1<-sample(age_data, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
  mean_REACH_sample <- mean(REACH_sample1)
  cat("Mean of the REACH sample is ", mean_REACH_sample, " \n while the actual mean is   ", mean_age, "\n with a difference of ", mean_age - mean_REACH_sample, " which is     pretty good... as expected", "\n")
  }

```
Now, as we've worked a bit on what does it mean that a variable is normally distributed, let's look at another variable, namely capital_gain which tells us annual gains from financial instruments outside of standard wages etc. 

Let's further assume that we don't know anything about the underlying "population" but rather just take a sample and go for it. Let's take a sample of 106 observations from this and get our factsheet ready. 

```{r}
REACH_sample2<-sample(capital_data, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
  mean_REACH_sample2 <- mean(REACH_sample2)
  cat("Mean capital gain is ", mean_REACH_sample2, " and we are good to go.")

```
All looks good unless you are REALLY smart, or you happen to run the above calculation a couple of times. Let's do it. 

```{r}
REACH_sample2<-sample(capital_data, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
mean_REACH_sample2 <- mean(REACH_sample2)
cat("Mean capital gain is ", mean_REACH_sample2, "\n")
for (i in 1:5){
  REACH_sample2<-sample(capital_data, size = 100, replace = FALSE)
  mean_REACH_sample2 <- mean(REACH_sample2)
  cat("Mean capital gain is ", mean_REACH_sample2, " WTF! \n")
}

```
If you had (easily) now reported that with a 95% confidence, the sample mean is within +-10% from the true mean, you'd be clearly lying as - first of all - our sample mean seem to be all over the place. There's something fishy going on with this data. You'd next probably wanna plot this out and see what the #%#ck is going on. 

```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  plot(sample(capital_data, size = 100, replace = FALSE))
}
```
It's starting to look there's nothing very normal at all with our samples which begs the question whether we can use our normal tools at all. In this case, it's certain that we should not rely on our standard sample size calculation which is based on the (now wrong) assumption that the underlying data is normally distributed. 

Let's go back into the population data and look what's actually goin on at the actual population data by examining the capital gains.Let's first look at the standard statistics of the capital population and then calculate how much data lies within one standard deviation from the true mean. 

```{r}
capital_data <-dataset$capital_gain
mean_capital <-mean(capital_data)
cat("mean capital gain is", mean_capital, "\n")
sd_capital <-sd(capital_data)
cat("standard deviation of capital gain is", sd_capital, "\n")
kurtosis_capital <- kurtosis(capital_data)
cat("kurtosis of capital gain is", kurtosis_capital, "\n")

lower_limit <- mean_capital - sd_capital
upper_limit <- mean_capital + sd_capital
between_sd_values <- capital_data[capital_data >= lower_limit & age_data <= upper_limit]
percentage_between_sd_values <- length(between_sd_values)/length(capital_data)
cat("And as we see, ", percentage_between_sd_values, " % of the values fall within one standard deviation from the mean, meaning our dataset is not normal which is further illustrated by the kurtosis ", kurtosis_capital, " indicating a fat tail, which should make us worry")


```
I'll make a histogram of the data to further illustrate the underlying realities. 

```{r}
ordered_capital_data_asc <- capital_data[order(capital_data, decreasing = FALSE)]
plot(ordered_capital_data_asc, xlab="ordered observations", ylab="gain in USD")
```
The main point here is that unless the underlying population data is normally distributed, nothing what you expect to work does not work. There are indeed some sophisticted models what can be used to tackle such phenomena but those are out of our reach and thus we should be careful. Lending from Nassim Taleb, these phenomenas follow 'fractal' or power law properties and should be thus handled differently. 

The main point is that there is no easy way to tackle such data and by removing 'outliers' you are just fooling yourself a bit more and in the worst case scenario, delivering misleading data. In other words, your sample does not tell anything about the underlying characteristics of the population. 

And since we are speaking and I'm inspired, let's see how well the capital_gain dataset represents the famous Pareto distribution



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
